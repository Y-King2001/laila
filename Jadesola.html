                Not your will but fate<br />
                Not my will but your decision<br /> 
                Our small world is being introduced into extinction<br />
                The walls of our world went crumbling<br />
                Faster than even the speed of light<br />
                Once envied, now mocked at<br />
                Is it wrong to want to stay by each other's side forever?<br />
                What went wrong with our song of forever?<br />
                Now, Tuesdays are sad days<br />
                And Mondays now mourn days<br />
                The days breaks without your care<br />
                Our everything now nothing<br />

                    If I could go back in time,  I'd capture every moment<br /> 
                    Maybe it could be fixed <br /> 
                    Maybe I'd guard my heart better <br /> 
                    All I had in my head was the SEVEN LETTER WORD "FOREVER"<br /> 
                    Am unexpected end <br /> 
                    No prior talks, no prior issues, no prior disagreement <br /> 
                    Just a blunt end <br /> 
                    "Everything has an end" <br /> 
                    What a way to consider each other?<br /> 
                    How do I say I miss you and what we had<br /> 
                    Sisters not haters now people with blisters<br /> 
                    Even fixes could not get this done <br /> 
                    So now, we keep distance <br />

                    A sunny Afternoon <br /> 
                    Beautiful day ahead <br /> 
                    Thought it was just about to be fun <br /> 
                    From a thought, came a decision<br /> 
                    From a decision, came a text <br /> 
                    Just a text ruins the day<br /> 
                    And now, we're back to bring strangers<br />
